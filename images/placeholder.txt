This folder will contain the following images:
- hero.jpg (A high-quality image of fresh pasta as the hero background)
- pasta-making.jpg (Image showing the pasta making process)
- cooking-class.jpg (Image of people participating in a cooking class)
- logo.svg (The i Matterelli logo)

In a real implementation, you would add these actual image files to this directory.
